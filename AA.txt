To send a transaction you send a user operation 

so offchain -> Google or any sign in -> Goes to the Alt mempool nodes (not to ethereum validator, so these alt mempool nodes gonna pay the gas fees and define params and 
send the tansaction to the ethereum entryPoint.sol(ERC-4337))  

Paymaster -> It is going to pay on your behalf 
Signature aggregator -> Multi people can sign the transaction here  

Account Abstraction by default in ZkSync
